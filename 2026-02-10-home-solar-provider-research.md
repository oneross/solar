# Comprehensive Home Solar Provider Research Report
## For Hawthorne and Ramsey, NJ (Bergen County)
**February 10, 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of factors to consider when selecting a home solar provider in Northern New Jersey, with specific focus on Hawthorne and Ramsey. It includes a first-principles decision framework, evaluation of specific providers mentioned (Trinity Solar, Infinity Energy, Green Power Energy), and critical 2026-specific considerations.

**Key 2026 Context:**
- The 30% federal solar tax credit was **eliminated for direct consumer purchases** as of January 1, 2026
- Tax credit benefits are now only accessible through PPAs/leases (third-party ownership models)
- This fundamentally changes the buy vs. lease calculation for 2026

---

## Part 1: First-Principles Decision Framework

### 1.1 Ownership Models

| Model | How It Works | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Who Owns | Home Sale Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Cash Purchase** | Pay full amount | $15K-$30K | $0 | You | ✅ +3-10% value |
| **Solar Loan** | Finance over 10-25 years | $0 | $100-$250 | You | ✅ +3-10% value |
| **PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)** | Pay per kWh generated | $0 | Variable | Company | ⚠️ Complicates sale |
| **Lease** | Fixed monthly payment | $0 | Fixed $68-$150 | Company | ⚠️ Complicates sale |

**2026 Reality Check:** With the federal ITC eliminated for purchases, PPAs have become more financially attractive because the financing company captures the tax credit and passes savings to you. However, this comes with significant home sale complications.

### 1.2 Critical Decision Factors

#### Financial Factors
| Factor | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Total Cost of Ownership** | High | 25-year cost including financing, escalators, buyout options |
| **Monthly Savings** | High | Electric bill reduction vs. solar payment |
| **Break-even Point** | Medium | Typical: 7-12 years for purchase, never for lease/PPA |
| **Incentives Captured** | High | SREC-II value, tax exemptions |
| **Home Sale Impact** | High | Will this complicate selling your home? |

#### Technical Factors
| Factor | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Equipment Quality** | High | Panel tier, inverter type (string vs. micro) |
| **System Size** | High | Properly sized for your usage |
| **Warranty Coverage** | High | Panel (25 yrs), inverter (12-25 yrs), workmanship (10-25 yrs) |
| **Production Guarantee** | Medium | Guaranteed kWh output |

#### Provider Factors
| Factor | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Company Longevity** | High | Years in business, financial stability |
| **BBB Rating & Complaints** | Medium | A+ rating with complaints = they respond; NR = avoid |
| **Google/Yelp Reviews** | Medium | Pattern of issues, not individual complaints |
| **Local Presence** | Medium | Service response time |
| **Installation Quality** | High | In-house vs. subcontractors |

#### Property-Specific Factors
| Factor | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Roof Age/Condition** | Critical | If roof needs replacement in <7 years, do that first |
| **Structural Capacity** | High | Old houses (pre-1970) need structural assessment |
| **Shade/Orientation** | High | South-facing with minimal shade is ideal |
| **HOA Restrictions** | Medium | NJ Solar Access Law protects most homeowners |

## Part 2: New Jersey Specific Considerations (2026)

### 2.1 Current Incentives

| Incentive | Value | Duration | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **SREC-II (SuSI Program)** | $85/MWh | 15 years | Fixed rate, ~$7,000-$9,000 lifetime value |
| **Federal ITC** | 30% | N/A | ❌ **No longer available for purchases in 2026** |
| **Property Tax Exemption** | 100% | Permanent | Solar adds no property tax |
| **Sales Tax Exemption** | 6.625% | Permanent | No sales tax on system purchase |
| **Net Metering** | 1:1 retail rate | Until program changes | Full credit for excess energy |

**Critical 2026 Change:** The direct federal tax credit is gone. The only way for homeowners to access ITC benefits now is through third-party ownership (leases/PPAs), where the financing company claims the credit and passes savings to you.

### 2.2 Net Metering Details

- **PSE&G** (serves Ramsey/Hawthorne area): 1:1 net metering
- Annual true-up: Credits roll over monthly, settled annually
- Excess credits at end of year paid at wholesale rate (lower value)
- Proper system sizing is critical: match production to consumption

### 2.3 Utility Considerations

| Utility | Coverage | Net Metering | Grid Access Fee |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| PSE&G | Bergen County | Yes, 1:1 | ~$8-12/month remains |
| JCP&L | Parts of NJ | Yes, 1:1 | Similar |

**Note:** You'll always pay a small grid access fee (~$8/month) even with solar. This is normal and expected.

### 2.4 Local Permitting (Bergen County)

- **Building permit required** for all solar installations
- **Electrical permit** required
- **Utility interconnection agreement** with PSE&G
- Permit timeline: 2-6 weeks typical
- Good installers handle all permitting as part of their service

## Part 3: Provider Evaluations

### 3.1 Trinity Solar (Wall Township, NJ)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **BBB Accredited** | Since 12/6/2001 | ✅ Long history |
| **BBB Rating** | A+ | ✅ Responds to complaints |
| **BBB Complaints** | 211 (3 years), 85 (12 months) | ⚠️ High volume |
| **BBB Customer Reviews** | 3.63/5 (167 reviews) | ⚠️ Mixed |
| **Yelp Rating** | 1.6/5 (136 reviews) | 🔴 Very poor |
| **Service Area** | 6-7 states, major NJ footprint | ✅ |
| **Founded** | 1994 | ✅ 30+ years |
| **Ownership** | Private | ✅ |

**Common Complaints:**
- Poor communication and project manager responsiveness
- Installation delays and canceled appointments
- High-pressure sales tactics (aggressive door-to-door)
- Roof damage during installation
- Difficulties with warranty fulfillment
- **Financing partner bankruptcy** (recent issue)

**Common Positives:**
- Installation crews often praised as professional
- Long-standing presence in Northeast
- Responds to BBB complaints (hence A+ rating)

**Contract Terms (per your notes):**
- ~$68/month with multiple financing partners
- $8/month remains to electric company
- 25-year contract
- Buyout after 5 years: ~$10,500 prorated

**Assessment:** Large, established company with significant complaint volume. The A+ BBB rating means they respond to complaints, not that customers are satisfied. High-pressure sales tactics are a red flag. The financing partner bankruptcy issue is concerning for ongoing support. **Use extreme caution; get everything in writing.**

### 3.2 Infinity Energy (Mahwah, NJ)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **BBB Accredited** | Since 4/26/2022 | ⚠️ Relatively new |
| **BBB Rating** | A+ | ✅ |
| **Google Rating** | 4.7/5 (623 reviews) | ✅ Excellent |
| **Yelp Rating** | 3.6/5 (25 reviews) | ⚠️ Mixed |
| **SolarReviews** | 3.4/5 (7 reviews) | ⚠️ Limited data |

| **EnergySage** | "Installer of the Year" Elite+ | ✅ Excellent |
| **Location** | 575 Corporate Dr, Mahwah | ✅ Very local |

**🔴 CRITICAL CONCERN:** A Reddit thread from late 2023 (160+ comments) discussed Infinity Energy potentially "closing down or going bankrupt." Comments included:
- "I work near their head office. They are closing up shop"
- "This is a company that was poorly managed from the top"

**Current Status (February 2026):** Their website (thenewutility.com) appears active, and they show as "Closed - Opens 9 AM Wed" on Google, suggesting they're still operating. However, **this history of potential instability requires verification before signing any contract.**

**Recommendation:** If meeting with them tomorrow, directly ask:
1. "I saw reports about financial difficulties in 2023. Can you address your current financial stability?"
2. "Who provides the warranty if your company goes out of business?"
3. "Can you provide bank or financial references?"

**Assessment:** Excellent reviews when operating normally, but concerning reports of potential business instability. Very local to you (Mahwah). **Verify financial stability before committing.**

### 3.3 Green Power Energy (Annandale, NJ)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **BBB Accredited** | Since 9/27/2016 | ✅ Good history |

| **Google Rating** | 4.7/5 (530 reviews) | ✅ Excellent |

**Common Feedback:**
- "Excellent company with professionals"
- "Competitive pricing, great service from sales to install"
- "Best price, tremendous service"
- Some complaints about salespeople disappearing post-contract

**Assessment:** Strong reputation, excellent reviews, long-established. Main concern is distance from Bergen County (Annandale is in Hunterdon County, ~45 miles from Ramsey). This could affect service response times. **Worth getting a quote; verify service commitment to Bergen County.**

### 3.4 Provider Comparison Matrix

| Factor | Trinity Solar | Infinity Energy | Green Power Energy |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **BBB Rating** | A+ | A+ | A+ |
| **Google Reviews** | N/A in results | 4.7/5 (623) | 4.7/5 (530) |

| **Sales Approach** | 🔴 Aggressive | ✅ Professional | ✅ Professional |

## Part 4: Old House Considerations

If Hawthorne or Ramsey home is older (pre-1970):

### Structural Assessment Requirements

| Factor | Threshold | Action Required |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Panel Weight** | 3-4 lbs/sq ft | Most roofs handle 20+ lbs/sq ft |
| **Total System Weight** | 600-2,400 lbs typical | Calculate for your array size |
| **Roof Age** | >10-15 years | Consider replacement before solar |
| **Pre-1970 Home** | Automatic | Structural engineer assessment |
| **Visible Sagging** | Any | Structural engineer required |
| **Rafter/Truss Condition** | Must inspect | Check for rot, decay |

### Cost Implications

| Scenario | Additional Cost | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Roof replacement needed | $8,000-$15,000 | Do before solar installation |
| Structural reinforcement | $2,000-$15,000 | Get engineering assessment |
| Ground mount alternative | $5,000-$15,000 premium | Consider if roof unsuitable |

**Key Rule:** If your roof needs replacement in the next 5-7 years, replace it BEFORE installing solar. Removing and reinstalling panels for a roof replacement costs $3,000-$8,000.

## Part 5: Home Sale Implications

This is **critically important** given the 2026 regulatory environment.

### Owned vs. Leased When Selling

| Factor | Owned Solar | Leased/PPA Solar |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Home Value Impact** | +3-10% ($9,000-$15,000+) | No increase, possible hindrance |
| **Sale Complexity** | Simple transfer | Buyer must qualify for lease |
| **Buyer Perception** | Asset | Liability |
| **Deal Risk** | Low | High (can kill deals) |
| **Transfer Process** | Include in sale | Requires lender approval, fees |

### The 2026 Dilemma

Since the federal tax credit is only available through PPAs in 2026:

**If you plan to sell within 5-7 years:**
- Consider whether the tax credit savings outweigh sale complications
- Negotiate strong buyout terms (prorated, clear pricing)
- Get the buyout schedule in writing before signing

**If you plan to stay long-term (10+ years):**
- PPA may make sense for the credit capture
- 25-year contract is less concerning if you're staying

### Trinity's Specific Terms Analysis

Based on your notes:
- **$68/month** with 25-year contract
- **$10,500 buyout** after 5 years (prorated thereafter)

**Questions to ask:**
1. What's the escalator rate? (Many PPAs increase 2-3% annually)
2. What's the exact buyout schedule for years 5-25?
3. What happens if you sell before year 5?
4. Can the buyer refuse the lease transfer?
